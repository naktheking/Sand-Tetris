This project is called 'Lauren Sands-Tris' or Sandtris for short. It's a derivative of the orginal tetris game
except the blocks turn into sands when it hits the floor or other 'sand' particles. The user coudl clear a row by
creating a connected row of sands of the same color, from left to right. 



To run the game, you have to run Board.py and that's it!

In Sandtris, a couple library is needed: 
random, pygame, threading, PIL libraries are all built into python

cmu_graphics, playsound are NOT built into python
which you can pip install both from:
cmu_graphics - https://pypi.org/project/cmu-graphics/
playsound - https://pypi.org/project/playsound/  



There are no keyboard shortcuts for the game.
